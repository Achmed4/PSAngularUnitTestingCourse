# Pluralsight's Unit Testing in Angular Course
This course is up to date.

To get started, clone the repo or download it

npm install
npm test

## IMPORTANT: do not try to run this code with "npm start" as it currently doesn't build. This isn't important to the course anyway, so just ignore that. Use "npm test" only.
